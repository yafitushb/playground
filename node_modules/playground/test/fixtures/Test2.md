# Simple Variables

Use `let` to make a constant and `var` to make a variable. The value of a constant doesnâ€™t need to be known at compile time, but you must assign it a value exactly once. This means you can use constants to name a value that you determine once but use in many places

```swift
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50
let myConstant = 42
```
